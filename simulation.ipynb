    "**Simulation Design for Mitochondrial Lineage Tracing and Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation consists of four main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stem Cell Growth Simulation**: Modeling the proliferation of stem cells using the Gillespie algorithm.\n",
    "2. **Mitochondrial Genome Proliferation**: Simulating mtDNA replication, mutation accumulation, and segregation during cell division.\n",
    "3. **Cell Differentiation Simulation**: Modeling asymmetric division of progenitor cells and differentiation into various cell types.\n",
    "4. **Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data Simulation**: Generating gene expression data using latent variables and sampling from a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Simulation of Stem Cell Growth**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1. Model Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "We simulate stem cell growth by conceptualizing cell division as a continuous-time Markov process. The division rate \\( p(t) \\) of a stem cell at time \\( t \\) is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "p(t) = r \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\kappa (t - t_0)}}\\right),\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( r \\) is the maximum division rate.\n",
    "- \\( \\kappa \\) controls the rate at which the growth accelerates.\n",
    "- \\( t_0 \\) represents the inflection point in time when the growth rate changes significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2. Simulation Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm to model the timing of cell divisions. Starting from a single stem cell, we simulate cell divisions until the desired population size is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Simulation of Mitochondrial Genome Proliferation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.1. Initial mtDNA Population**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each stem cell contains an initial population of mtDNA molecules. We simulate the replication and death of mtDNA molecules within the cell until a target copy number (e.g., 500 copies) is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.2. mtDNA Replication and Mutation**\n",
    "\n",
    "During cell division, mtDNA molecules replicate, and mutations can occur. The key aspects of the mtDNA dynamics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Replication**: Each mtDNA molecule replicates once.\n",
    "- **Mutation Accumulation**: Mutations occur during replication, with the number of mutations following a Poisson distribution.\n",
    "- **Segregation**: mtDNA molecules are randomly segregated into daughter cells during cell division.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.3. Mutation Rate Estimation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming a per-mitosis mutation rate for mtDNA that is higher than nuclear DNA, we estimate the expected number of mtDNA mutations per cell division:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Expected mutations per division} = \\mu \\times \\text{mtDNA copies},\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( \\mu \\) is the mutation rate per mtDNA molecule per division.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Simulation of Cell Differentiation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.1. Differentiation Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "After stem cell growth, cells differentiate according to specified models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Differentiation**: Stem cells differentiate into progenitor cells, which further differentiate into a single cell type.\n",
    "- **Bifurcated Differentiation**: Progenitor cells differentiate into multiple cell types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.2. Asymmetric Division of Progenitor Cells**\n",
    "\n",
    "Progenitor cells undergo asymmetric division:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One daughter cell remains a progenitor cell capable of self-renewal and further differentiation.\n",
    "- The other daughter cell differentiates into a specialized cell type and no longer divides.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.3. Differentiation Probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell differentiation is modeled as a continuous-time Markov process, with a differentiation probability \\( q_{ij}(t) \\) at time \\( t \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "q_{ij}(t) = 1 - p_i(t),\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( p_i(t) \\) is the probability that a cell remains in its current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Simulation of Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.1. Gene Expression Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "We simulate gene expression for each cell, accounting for cell-type-specific and shared genes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cell-Type-Specific Genes**: Comprise 40% of the simulated genes, following distinct expression programs in different cell types.\n",
    "- **Shared Genes**: The remaining genes, with consistent expression across cell types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.2. Two-Step Expression Simulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Latent Expression Generation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   For each gene, we generate a latent expression variable \\( z_t \\) for cell generation \\( t \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   z_t \\sim \\text{Normal}(\\mu_t, \\sigma^2),\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "   where \\( \\mu_t \\) is the mean expression level dependent on the cell's generation and cell type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sampling Expression Data**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   The observed gene expression \\( x_t \\) is sampled from a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   x_t \\sim \\text{ZINB}(\\lambda = e^{z_t}, \\theta, \\pi),\n",
    "   \\]\n",

    "### **6. Simulation of Sequencing Read Depth for Mitochondrial Mutations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.1. Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In sequencing data, the total read depth (DP) represents the number of sequencing reads covering a particular genomic position, while the allele depth (AD) represents the number of reads supporting a specific allele (e.g., a mutation) at that position. Including DP and AD in our simulation allows us to model the stochastic nature of sequencing and the variability in detecting mitochondrial mutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.2. Modeling Read Depth**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each mitochondrial mutation in each cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total Read Depth (DP)**: Simulated using a suitable distribution (e.g., Poisson or Negative Binomial) to reflect variability in sequencing coverage.\n",
    "- **Allele Read Depth (AD)**: Simulated based on the heteroplasmy level of the mutation and the total read depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.3. Implementation Details**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Per-Mutation DP Simulation**: We simulate the DP for each mutation site in each cell.\n",
    "- **AD Calculation**: Given the DP and the heteroplasmy level (proportion of mtDNA molecules carrying the mutation), we simulate the AD using a binomial distribution.\n",
    "- **Error Modeling**: We can include sequencing errors by introducing a base error rate, affecting the observed AD.\n",

    "### **8. Code Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Definitions**:\n",
    "  - `mtDNA` class represents individual mtDNA molecules, tracking their mutations.\n",
    "  - `Cell` class represents cells in the simulation, storing lineage information and cell type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mtDNA Dynamics Functions**:\n",
    "  - `introduce_mutations` introduces mutations into mtDNA molecules during replication.\n",
    "  - `replicate_and_segregate_mtDNA` handles mtDNA replication and random segregation into daughter cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cell Growth and Differentiation Functions**:\n",
    "  - `simulate_stem_cell_growth` models stem cell divisions using the Gillespie algorithm.\n",
    "  - `simulate_cell_differentiation` models differentiation of stem cells into progenitor cells and further into differentiated cells.\n",
    "  - `progenitor_asymmetric_division` simulates asymmetric division of progenitor cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gene Expression Simulation Functions**:\n",
    "  - `generate_gene_params` initializes gene-specific parameters for the simulation.\n",
    "  - `generate_latent_expression` computes the latent expression levels \\( z_t \\) for genes in a cell.\n",
    "  - `sample_expression` samples gene expression counts from a ZINB distribution.\n",
    "  - `simulate_gene_expression_for_cells` simulates gene expression data for all cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Main Execution**:\n",
    "  - The simulation proceeds through stem cell growth, differentiation, parameter generation, and gene expression simulation.\n",
    "  - The final gene expression data is stored in `expression_df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Simulating Read Depth (DP and AD)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function `simulate_read_depth`**:\n",
    "  - For each cell, we calculate the heteroplasmy levels of mutations.\n",
    "  - Total read depth (DP) for each mutation site is simulated using a Negative Binomial distribution to model overdispersion in sequencing coverage.\n",
    "  - Allele depth (AD) is simulated using a Binomial distribution based on the heteroplasmy level and the total read depth.\n",
    "  - Sequencing errors are included by adjusting the effective heteroplasmy with the base error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Parameters Used**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`mean_dp`**: The average total read depth per mutation site. This value can be adjusted to reflect different sequencing depths.\n",
    "- **`dp_dispersion`**: Controls the variance of the total read depth. A higher value indicates more overdispersion.\n",
    "- **`base_error_rate`**: The probability of a sequencing error at any given base. This affects the observed allele depth, particularly for low-frequency mutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Storing DP and AD**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each cell's mitochondrial mutation profile is stored in the `mutation_profile` attribute, which is a dictionary mapping mutations to their DP and AD values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Results and Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gene Expression Data**:\n",
    "  - The simulated gene expression data (`expression_df`) contains realistic counts that mimic single-cell RNA-seq data.\n",
    "  - The data reflects cell-type-specific expression patterns due to the inclusion of cell-type-specific genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cell Type Distribution**:\n",
    "  - The simulation tracks the number of cells in each cell type, allowing for analysis of differentiation dynamics."
